# Stub

1. Implement a version of the interface that you want to mock
2. Add calls to your interface
3. Define the expectations

Basically, we want to define a set of inputs and outputs for each call, then construct
a matrix of that info, then run validation that each of those items are used correctly

[
    [in1, in2, in3], [out1, out2, out3],
    [in1, in2, in3], [out1, out2, out3],
    [in1, in2, in3], [out1, out2, out3],
]

```go

```
